difference between abstract class and interface

      Abstract class                            interface
      you can only extend one                   you can implement more than
      abstract class at a time

      abstract class can                        no instance variables allowed
      have instance variables

Java7 --                                       methods are 100% abstract

      can I static method ?
Java 7      yes                                 no
Java 8      yes                                 yes

----------
What is so good ?

java 8 was complete makeover for interface
__________________________________________
Functional Programming --> Object Oriented Programming

function === methods
functions are treated as first class citizen

java 8 added functional interface


public class  implements IGreeting {
    @Override
    public String greet() {
        return "How are you doing ?";
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {

    }
}
